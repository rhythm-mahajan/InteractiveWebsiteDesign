# WebsiteDesign

A local business asked you to develop an interactive website for them. These are the conditions for the website:

1. It should be an accessible website.
2. It should be responsive (the content that is shown to the user should be appropriate 
based on user’s device resolution).
3. The website should have at least the following pages: Home, About Us and Contact Us. 
Any other pages will be based on the business needs. For example, a restaurant’s
website need a page about the menu, whereas a beauty salon’s website need a page 
about the services that they offered.
4. The website should be interactive, you need JavaScript for this purpose.
5. Make sure your design is matching with the target audience and business needs
